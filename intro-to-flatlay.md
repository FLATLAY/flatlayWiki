## Coordinating as a team

As a team, we generally communicate through Telegram/Skype threads focusing on one element of FLATLAY. You'll be added to the threads you need to keep an eye on!
In some aspects, we work like a relay team. In order for the relay to work properly, the next team needs to be notified that the work is done, so please be sure to send the completed materials and to tag the next member of your team in the Telegram thread.
