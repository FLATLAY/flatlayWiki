### On-boarding form
We are in the process of rolling out a self-serve portal for D2C retailers and brands to match-make and work directly with content creators on a performance basis. I’ve included a short synopsis below along with a Google on-boarding form we are using for clients as we kick off 1-1 pilots with select partners via this invite. Would you mind answering the quick 10 question survey for us to help strategize a custom plan?

Let me know if there are any other questions I can answer in the meantime and look forward to working with you.


### What is FLATLAY
Flatlay is the visual storytelling platform for products. The team’s vision is built around a content first approach, where commerce is entirely driven experientially whether online or in-store. The user workflow and management system caters to D2C channels for existing or newly incepted brands in a category the company defines as User-Generated Commerce.

The social marketplace and suite of publishing tools help creatives build, share and monetize product content while allowing brands & retailers to upload affiliated goods & offers into the workflow management system. The platform provides the ability to directly integrate and send product to brand advocates hired for media campaigns distributed programmatically.

The proprietary middleware amplifies content on 3rd party publisher networks and sites such as CondeNast, Hearst, Time Inc. & Refinery29 working with its network of +100k content creators and millions of products integrated from Amazon, Shopify, Linkshare & WooCommerce. The platform scales campaigns against premium brand-safe inventory, maximizing ROI on the sourced and served creative content.

- working with enterprise merchants and retail customers to source and serve purchasable content into native deployments across their O&O sites, apps, online catalogues and paid social placements

- 1 of the 30 exclusive Shopify Sales Channel partners and an Amazon Marketplace App Store Partner

- Snap, Pinterest, FB/IG, Twitter preferred partner for optimized social media buying

- Turnkey DSP delivery to over 55,000 premium publishers leveraging proprietary marketplace middleware

### How does FLATLAY work (what are the specifics)
The software provides additional services & insights aside from running paid media campaigns. That's a separate add on that we can begin to explore as the relationship grows (see pricing attachment). We support hiring influencers for existing or original content depending on whether you are looking to source a particular type of creative for use to run on your own social channels or for paid media placements on 3rd party sites. If its purely performance based (conversions), we clarify that to the influencers and they engage accordingly.
 
As for media buying campaigns, we have the ability to run native creative placements on a CPA basis and can run CPM/CTR/CPA so long as we have a minimum budget threshold to optimize against. With a committed total by each campaign, we leverage the minimum spend based on the KPI (i.e. CPA of $1.25 based on a minimum spend of $2500 per month) to allow us enough leverage to make sure we hit the goal metrics. 
 
We break down targeting into seed models based on the demographic you are looking to reach (i.e. fashionistas, music enthusiasts, etc.), so we will find tastemakers or influential creatives with a relevant audience to base from. If you and the team have particular details (geo, dates, etc.) surrounding a campaign you are looking to kick off with, let us know so that we can draft something up to gauge the campaigns reach.
 
Integrations simple, we use the existing affiliate feed and will circle back with a login when ready for use with the company social accounts to customize the recommendations.
