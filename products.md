## Businesses
Businesses and brands are prompted into two actions: integrating their products (so that Creatives can sell them), creating a campaign and the recommendation engine. FLATLAY enables them to select Creatives for their campaign by either taking advantage of Social Audience Modelling or creating a list of the people they are interested in collaborating with (from both in and out of the network - anyone with a public social handle). 

Features are available based on the tier the business is subscribed to. Both monthly and yearly (discounted) plan are available. In-depth descriptions of each plan and feature can be found at https://wiki.flatlay.io/copywriting/glossary-of-terms.

## Creatives
FLATLAY's aim is to promote user generated commerce, through two main avenues:
### Creating Content
Creatives are encouraged to interact with the brands/products they enjoy by creating shoppable content (Collections). The end goal is to have the program auto-tag products, as of July 2019, users are able to search through a list of recommended tags. Creatives can also browse other users content and make purchases.
### Working on Branded Campaigns
Creatives can either be invited to a private by the brand, or they can apply to participate in an open-call campaign.
