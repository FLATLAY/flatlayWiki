## Businesses
Businesses and brands are prompted into two actions: integrating their products (so that Creatives can sell them), and creating a campaign. FLATLAY enables them to select Creatives for their campaign by either taking advantage of Social Audience Modelling or creating a list of the people they are interested in collaborating with (from both inside and out of the network). 

Features are available based on the tier the business is subscribed to. Both monthly and yearly (discounted) plan are available. In-depth descriptions of each plan and feature can be found at https://wiki.flatlay.io/copywriting/glossary-of-terms.

## Creatives
FLATLAY's aim is to promote user generated commerce, through two main avenues:
### Creating Content
Creatives are encouraged to interact with the brands/products they enjoy by creating shoppable content (Collections). The end goal is to have the program auto-tag products, as of July 2019, users are able to search through a list of recommended tags. Creatives can also browse other users content and make purchases.
### Working on Branded Campaigns
Creatives can either be invited to a private by the brand, or they can apply to participate in an open-call campaign.
