# Processes
## Communicating with the team

Most of the communication is done through various Telegram channels. Before handing off new assets/iterations to the developer team, changes should be incorporated into a mock-up and the assets should be uploaded to Google Drive.

## Versioning

1. New versions should be labelled with the date. Changes should be incorporated into a mock-up before delivering the assets + mockup to the developer team.
2. All the changes should be explained, either on every page on the design file or separately via a support document (/mockup).
3. If there are special interactions between the elements involved, it should be marked as such and explained in detail.
4. All text and changes to text needs to be typed out so that they can be copy and pasted.


## Assets

All of the assets should be uploaded to the Google Drive. An accompanying PDF (mockup/explanation) of the asset should be handed off with the folder if necessary. Both the zip and PDF should be labelled with the same name and version (by date).

## Format
Most of the design materials can be made in Adobe Illustrator or XD.
