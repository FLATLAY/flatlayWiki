## Flatlay description
Commerce is quickly evolving, and the discovery process has shifted far beyond the Brick & Mortar experience. We’ve witnessed thousands of malls and storefronts shutter, along with the bankruptcies of namebrands we’ve known for ages  (2018 view).
Consumer spending isn’t decreasing — but shifting further to retailers, brands and technology partners focused on the direct to consumer movement. Yet digitally-native brands like Lush Cosmetics, are moving entirely away from social and taking millions of fans with them. They’re tired of fighting with algorithms for attention and marginalized profits.

Now the problem is that brands need a more efficient way to capture the attention of consumers -- and that's done by engaging them. Those building 2-way dialogues with customers and advocates will be the ones to thrive.

Enter Flatlay - a popular and impactful content focused on the visual storytelling of products -- with millions of posts done by everyday creatives (pause).

We've built a marketplace network around this user behavior, providing a suite of easy-to-use tools to create a digital storefront in seconds, codelessly. 
Through content-driven commerce, Flatlay empowers the creator economy. 

Users build shoppable collections from millions of products to generate revenue from affiliate sales along with the opportunity to be hired directly by brands for original content.

The tools are tied to a portal where brands & retailers use a campaign work-flow system to match with the right advocates at scale. The platform builds seed models based on key persona’s focused on the target market, and uses machine learning to continuously match lookalike creatives. Clients can then source existing content OR hire creatives for original content while ensuring the copyright.

Flatlay works as on a SaaS model based on monthly tiered services for DTC brands & agencies. While enterprise clients spend anywhere from $10k-$20k with us every month to scale performance with 80% margins.

One enterprise client, Zalando, uses us to power a segment called Get The Look. We source thousands of pieces of brand-safe content monthly and use computer vision to automatically tag products SKU’s. The combination sets are then programmatically delivered across their sites and apps performing 300% better than their in-house teams.

We've organically registered a network of nearly 100k members on the site and are now rolling out native iOS/Android to scale with new content formats to make it more experiential.
