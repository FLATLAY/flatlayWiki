<!-- TITLE: Copywriting and Marketing -->

# Do's and Dont's
## Buzzwords we like:
* Engagement
* Impact
* Crowdsourced
* Community
* Conversion-focused
* User-generated commerce

## Do's
* Use clear, simple, short sentences.
* Emphasize what the user is gaining from the platform, rather than explaining for the sake of explaining.
* Be consistent with the terminology you're using throughout the site.

## Dont's
* Too many buzzwords in one area (especially on the Creatives side).
* Concepts/terms that alienate the reader.
* Using inconsistent terminology to explain our features.
* Sentences you canâ€™t read out loud without boring yourself.
* Sentences that make your head hurt from too many technical terms.
* Using the same adjectives/words twice in the same paragraph (use synonyms instead).
* Use the word influencer to describe creatives.


# Processes
## Communicating with the team
The direct contact for copywriting is Ali. Once materials are approved, work with the graphic designer to create a mockup of the latest iteration. Communication is through Skype and through dedicated Telegram channels.

## Tools
Use Google Slides so that reviews can be done in real time, and all dedicated team members can add changes as we go. When re-working a section on a website, it is helpful to keep a screenshot of current page on the website so that it is easier to orient ourselves.
